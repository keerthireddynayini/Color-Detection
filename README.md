# Color-Detection
Real-time color detection using OpenCV, capturing RGB values from webcam feed with mouse interaction. Matches detected colors to a predefined dataset (colors.csv) to display color names and hex codes. Includes accuracy validation feature by comparing user-provided ground truth with detected colors.
